#Simple Firefox Stringreplace Extension

I created this little add-on for ff >= 38.0. It searches for a specific string after every page load and replaces it. In this case 'ibm' with 'wixxer'.

##Building
You will need Node.js and JPM to build this addon.

###Running the code
Navigate to the root directory in your prefered console and run `jpm run -v` for debugging.

###Compiling an add-on file
Run `jpm xpi` in the root directory. Then drag&drop the file in ff.

Theres also a precompiled (.xpi) in the root directory.

Feel free to reuse this code. It not be maintained in future. Pull requests may get accepted though.
